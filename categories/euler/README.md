# Project Euler

http://projecteuler.net/

This is a directory to post answers to project euler questions.

Use the file format `prob000-author.pl`, replacing "000" with the
problem number and "author" with your name.  For example if I am eric256 and
I answer problem No. 1, I will save it as `prob001-eric256.pl`.

Thanks for playing!
